## Summary
I live in Hoboken, NJ right across the Hudson River from NYC. I have worked in the city and frequently go in for pleasure. My old boss frequently warned our team of the dangerous of driving in the city and to always be on the lookout for distracted drivers due to the high number of motor vehicle incidents.

While I don't doubt that NYC has a high number of vehicle incidents, I wanted to use publically available data to find out what factors caused the most unsafe conditions. This is a personal Exploratory Data Analysis of Motor Vehicle Collisions in  New York City from November 2012 - Novemeber 2022.
